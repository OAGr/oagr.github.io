			Most of What I&#8217;m Writing Is Probably Wrong</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The world is really complicated.  So when I, or anyone else comes across with a point, we’re doing so with a very limited set of information.  Even the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/07/pundit-forecasts-all-wrong-silver-perfectly-right-is-punditry-dead/">experts</a> typically get things wrong.  That makes it pretty hopeless for anyone else.</p>

<p>That said, we need to pretend we know things.  Why?  Because everyone else does, and if you admit that you don’t know things people will believe you.  But they will continue believing those who pretend to know things, so you’ll look worse in comparison.  It’s like a bizarre athletic contest where everyone is cheating with hacks and steroids and those who don’t quickly get kicked out for not doing well in comparison.  </p>

<p>I’m quite sure that one can only read the intelligence of less intelligent people.  It’s kind of like Jazz; to an untrained ear <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Parker">Charlie Parker</a> could sound as good as some amateur enthusiast.  I realized this quickly when I played jazz; no matter how good I actually was, if I played loud and confident during my solos people would assume I knew more than them and was actually quite impressive if only they understood jazz a bit better.  </p>

<p>So when I talk I’ll continue to state things like they are true, even though I completely realize that most of them are highly uncertain.  I’ve been considering making a new language for this similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime">E-prime,</a> but it probably wouldn’t help much for normal conversation.</p>

<p>This is important to accept because otherwise I would never say things.  I realize that much of what I talk about has been discussed before.  I could theoretically research every subject to its academic end and argue the points for those who know where the subject elite stand.  But the only people who typically do this, are the PHDs who spend a few years doing nothing but researching the literature to find this end.  Which means I would be constrained to one very specific field, and spend several years of life achieving that.  </p>

<p>What I’m saying is that the ends don’t matter too much because they are likely to be wrong.  And there’s probably some very interesting optimization process in deciding how much information you have to know about an argument to be able to contribute to it.  But the most important information is buried within the individual arguments and ideas to back them up.  The outcomes and weighing of those arguments is less important because there are probably many that I’m unaware of given my limited expertise.  </p>

<p>So I’ll continue to talk and listen to things that interest me, no matter how much I know about them.  And even if my general mentality is wrong (it likely will be much of the time), I hope that I have things to say within them that may be useful to the greater information.</p>

			Just What Are We Giving Our Soldiers?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/care-packages.jpg"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/care-packages.jpg?w=490" alt="Image" /> </a></p>

<p>Take a brief look at <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Support-Deployed-US-Troops">this article</a>.  Common advice to give help to soldiers involves guessing what kinds of things they may find valuable and shipping them halfway around the world.  If it’s to a battalion you don’t know supposedly you are encouraged to add a letter and hope they write back.</p>

<p>What is this?  Do they live on another planet?  Many of them have i <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080201144458AAqBpHH">nternet connections</a>.  In 5 seconds we should be able to start a Skype call with them.  We have websites like Amazon now that send you what you actually want, not a hodgepodge guess of what someone halfway across the world may come up with by reading a Wikihow article (or more often, not reading anything).  </p>

<p>This “let’s guess and give” strategy seems mediocre for 2,000 years ago.  </p>

<p>In addition, what is wrong with us that soldiers crave basic goods like <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Support-Deployed-US-Troops">socks and toothpaste</a>.  My guess is that the military provides them with basic essentials but few brand names or “luxuries” (very cheap ones).  They acknowledge that these items are nice and useful (they are fine with them coming as care packages) but won’t give them to their soldiers for some reason.  Strange budgeting perhaps?  </p>

<p>The few web services that support this thing seem to be <a href="http://www.adoptaussoldier.org//">stuck</a> <a href="http://www.give2thetroops.org/">2</a> <a href="http://operationonceinalifetime.com/">decades</a> ago.  </p>

<p>I would strongly imagine that if care packages were important, a team within the government would set up a really strong application to match people with soldiers and communicate with them and send them items they really care about.  Or better yet, Amazon should work out something to help send any possible item upon their request to their place (although I realize that some items may be limited).  Amazon should get on this if they haven’t yet.</p>

<p>But there should definitely be something better if we are to take this seriously; it’s both very possible and important.  If Americans actually care about soldiers, we might as well get serious about it and do it well.  </p>

<p>Footnote: One could say that the primary use of these care packages is to show support, not give basic goods.  But why then do soldiers request basic goods from care packages?  Plus, even if it was to provide support, maybe there could be some way of connecting similar donors with similar soliders (though this is a minor issue in comparison)</p>

<p>  Social feedback is really good at making people ordinary.  People don’t like strange things, and the negative reinforcement is quite quick and powerful. Most of the posts I’ve read about how to <a href="http://www.problogger.net/how-to-write-great-blog-content/">write</a> <a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/writing-a-good-blog.html"> good</a> <a href="http://smallbiztrends.com/2012/11/7-steps-to-writing-a-great-blog-post.html">blog</a> <a href="http://www.blogohblog.com/10-tips-for-writing-good-content-and-attracting-readers/">posts</a> talk about how to write good blog posts for blog popularity.  Which makes sense if you’re optimizing your blog for popularity, but I don’t think I am.  I’m trying to get my crazy thoughts out of my head before I forget them, and decided that I might as well improve my writing while doing it.  Plus I enjoy the fact that someone out there may find some of this interesting and perhaps engage me in a conversation more interesting than standard smalltalk nonsense. So if I were writing to be popular I wouldn’t do as well.  I’d worry when I wasn’t becoming popular.  I’ve tried writing posts before, submitting them on hacker news, waiting, and being disappointed when they wouldn’t become popular.  I stopped doing this, but now my posts are automatically posted on Twitter and Facebook.  I then get feedback from them, plus comments on the bottom of the post.  These are not harmless.  They put a metric in how well I’m doing, with a re-tweet count or like count or comment count.  The atmosphere encourages people to optimize for that which is easily seen and measurable, which is a problem because it’s not what I’m trying to optimize for!  It’s like school constantly reminding me of my G.P.A. when I’m trying my hardest not to care about my G.P.A. so I could get on to more important things.  At worst I accept someone else’s quite arbitrary measure of success, and at best I end up feeling a bit bad about myself because I did poorly on something that doesn’t matter to me anyway. First I’m trying my best to reject the standard definition of blog success.  Second I’ve changed the Wordpress updates to only some of my Facebook friends.  Ideally I would be able to have different friend groups see different sets of posts, but from what I understand nothing supports this (except maybe Google+, but few people I know use that anyway).  There’s actually a Facebook setting to help with this, though it’s really mediocre and hard to use.

There’s a lot more that I considered putting here, but I’ll just add it to later posts.  And if you’re disappointed that this post feels short and incomplete, then I don’t care anyway, because I don’t care about popularity.  :)  At least for this blog.  </p>

After doing a bit of research I found that I’m not the  <a href="http://www.joshspeters.com/how-to-optimize-the-ogdescription-tag-for-search-and-social">only one to notice this.</a>  Apparently LinkedIn and Google+ both use the Facebook OG tags to represent websites to people. Apparently Facebook realized that they needed good metadata to make sense of websites to show to people on their feed.  Metadata existed, but few seemed to be using it (except for SEO, which typically is a bit different than information users themselves are interested in).  The Semantic Web people have long tried to make sense and popularize metadata.  So it seems quite interesting that Facebook may be the organization to finally popularize it for the masses.   Facebook made the Open Graph for Facebook.  It’s really hard to tell how “open” they actually want it to be: whether they intend the open graph to be a Facebook dominated platform, or a universal one that Facebook can rely upon.  This is a really interesting question to me and I’ll definitely keep it in mind over the next few years.  Either way, it may be becoming the standard for other people to use as metadata. What does this mean?  Well, maybe you can incorporate Open Graph metadata from other applications into your website for starters.  More interesting relationships would be difficult, but it seems possible to scrape Open Graph data from websites to do things that could be interesting.  Facebook tags don’t really provide semantic data regarding the relationships between different objects, but some of this may be possible to be added using other services.</p>

			The Need for a Rigorous Morality</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When making life decisions about morality, reasons aren’t always good enough.  We need numbers. Quick challenge:  Try calculating the answers to the following questions, optimizing for the benefit of mankind.</p>

<ul>
  <li> How much should you tip waiters?</li>
  <li>Should you visit a family reunion or stay at home and do extra work?</li>
  <li>Should you go to a party at least once this month, or stay home and do work?</li>
  <li>Should you become a doctor or a politician?</li>
</ul>

<p>These are four everyday questions for someone trying to do good in the world in a somewhat optimal way.  For any of them we could come up with a few basic hypothesis followed by assumptions followed by a very uncertain decision.  However, I wonder what the optimal answers could be using all of existing human knowledge.  My guess is that these answers should be much better than what one of us may come up with in a few minutes or years. I’m looking for a rigorous infrastructure from which to make choices to optimize definitions of what is good with as high certainty as possible.  I define “good” in a utilitarian sense, but this could be modifiable.  Even in “utilitarian”, a definition of “utility” is quite flexible and open-ended.  The important thing is that there is an efficient way of optimizing for definitions of good, many of which are quite similar anyways. I expect many members of this site to already use simple Fermi calculations when making important decisions.  Right now that does seem to be about the most rigorous thing one can do.  However, Fermi calculations are very much constrained by the information you have available to you.  I still think Fermi calculations are important, but I would like a system to give us standards and heuristics to make them more feasible and useful. For example, take the problem above, “how much should you time waiters?”  A basic Fermi model may make estimations on all of the costs and benefits of tipping waiters, then do a few calculations and arrive at an answer. <strong>Advantages of tipping a waiter:</strong>
- a1) Help out the waiter financially
- a2) Make the waiter feel better
- a3) Make the waiter treat you better later on
- a4) Make yourself feel better
- a5) Convince yourself that you are a better person</p>

<p><strong>Advantages of not tipping a waiter:</strong>
- b1) More money to support existential risk / a better cause
- b2) Convince yourself that you are a better person (for some hardcore utilitarians)</p>

<p>Perhaps you conclude that by far the most important advantage is a4 and the most important disadvantage is b1, but even then this is a highly uncertain equation.  How do you best quantify how much better the tip would make you feel, and how will that impact your productivity in life?  Exactly how much will a few cents reduce existential risk?  Simple answers to these questions lead to more questions until one finally uses either intuition (my salary is fixed, so a productivity increase would probably have a “small” benefit) or heuristics (I’ve read somewhere that $1 is worth 3 future lives), which are what finally allow one to solve the problem analytically.  However, this rests on several assumptions, is highly uncertain, and takes a lot of time to do. A substantially more rigorously thought out moral system would be able to provide answers like: “When an average San Francisco waiter gets $1 extra income, global utility increases by approximately 15 +- 7 “utils”.  When an average San Francisco waiter is tipped $1, the emotional gratification upon that waiter increases by approximately 5 +- 3 utils. I don’t think this is impossible, just difficult.  The important thing to remember is that we don’t need a framework that is excellent or anywhere near perfect. We just need one that gives us answers that are a bit better than we would normally do.  Given that humans tend to not think about issues like this all too much, this may not be that difficult. <strong>Challenges with a Rigorous Morality</strong>
1. Accepting optimization as a moral system.  Many people object to the idea of optimizing as a moral framework.  Because this community is so accepting of utilitarian ideas, I won’t spend much time on this.
2. Complexity.  The calculation above of the tip got to be slightly complex.  A full and complete calculation could be arbitrarily large.  For example, just to calculate the benefit of a1, you may first look at happiness to income curves, then estimate the average family and friend size of the waiter to begin predicting the positive influence on people around the waiter.  There may be clever ways to simplify and approximate this, but it would take a lot of thought and still result in a very complex answer.  Most fermi problems are relatively simple, and humans definitely aren’t used to figuring things like this out on a routine basic.  A rigorous, scientific morality would do the heavy lifting and provide simple, but relatively correct, answers.
3. Uncertainty.  Many calculations involved in deciding what helps the world most are very uncertain.  Calculations may involve many assumptions, each of which would carry some uncertainty.  So the end result is incredibly open ended.  Most scientific statements aren’t statistical, but essentially every single social statement is.  Will purchasing a dog provide over $100 in extra productivity to you per day?  We could run scientific studies on how dogs have helped other people become happy, and how happiness in your specific specialization results in productivity, but even then there would still be quite a bit of uncertainty.  More difficult problems are obviously worse.When doing math, any calculations of large social phenomena will have a lot of uncertainty.  Even with the best of existing knowledge, we may only be able to estimate the benefit of a dollar on existential risk reduction by a few orders of magnitude.  However, even though this is very messy, it should still be better than our basic intuitions.  In my experience in engineering, most problems have relatively minor amounts of uncertainty (+- 30 to 60% at most).  Here it can be significantly more.  This calls for the need to understand large amounts of uncertainty.</p>

<p><strong>Principals of a Rigorous Morality:</strong> I believe that this way of thinking about morality and optimization leads us to the study and understanding of complex systems.  The tipping example can show us the beginnings of what may be described as a large “system” of assumptions and calculations.  The study of complex systems and networks has become quite popular in the last few decades and may help when structuring a system.
1. A graph-like structure.  A large system of fermi calculations (a relatively small one described in the tip example) can be seen to be made up of many similar structures or nodes.  In this case, we can say that a node represents a calculation, and a connection represents the use of the result of one calculation for another calculation.  Likewise we may be able to understand the structure of the system using a knowledge of graph theory and systems theory.
2. Heuristics (Simple outputs).  While a rigorous morality may be very complicated, it should be able to be interacted with in a relatively simple way.  A doctor may need years of medicine experience, but a patient should only need to know how to take a pill.  Likewise, a rigorous morality should be used to find take-aways and rules of thumb that can easily be applied to modern life.
3. Propagation of Uncertainty.  A rigorous morality would focus on the connections between different assumptions, each with different levels of uncertainty.  We can expect that this effectively will create “bottlenecks” whereby assumptions with high uncertainty mostly determine the uncertainty of the result.  Therefore it is important to focus on reducing uncertainty throughout a chain of assumptions such to minimize the uncertainty of the system, which is assumed to generally happen by focussing on the most uncertain elements of the system.  For example, if one has absolutely no idea how effective a nonprofit will be in existential risk reduction, most efforts to determine the exact amount of money saved by tipping will not be expected to improve the system’s decision.
4. Integration of intuitions.  A rigorous morality cannot be made up of only scientific data because most important assumptions in this field do not have scientific data.  Instead there will be situations where the most accurate expected answer is an intuitive one.  This may be a weighted sum of the intuitions of many people, and if so, that will need to be set up.    
5. Value of Information.  Most assumptions will not be worth modeling.  The time and effort that it takes to extend a rigorous morality should probably be decided on a basic of what is within the rigorous morality. For example, the tip example may not be worth spending much time on.  However, if I were to find out that every single person in the world would take my advice, I would spend more time on it (but there would be an ideal level of time to spend.)</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> A rigorous morality, as defined in this document, is expected to be very difficult to fully create.  It is expected that multiple revisions and lots of research and development will be necessary to create something really powerful.  However, I believe that it is definitely worth starting.  Rationality should win.</p>

			Books Are Essentially Free</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Don’t let the price for a good book deter you.  The time it takes you costs significantly more.  And even after that, there’s likely a huge consumer surplus. Personally I can easily take 5-15 hours on one book.  If my time was worth $10 per hour, that would be a contribution of $50 - $150 of my time on that book.  A $10-$20 extra cost for the object itself is trivial in comparison.  If it’s worth the time, it’s definitely worth the cost. So how valuable is the book to me?  Unless I’m making a very wrong decision, it seems like it must at least be worth the time it takes me to finish it. One can compare this to the costs of private school.  Personally I didn’t get much from spoken lectures.  Few of them held my attention.  Instead I’d learn mostly from the books and my peers while doing the work.  Without the books, I would estimate that my college career would have been at least 1/3rd less valuable.  That could easily be worth over $80,000 based on my <a href="http://www.hmc.edu/academicsclinicresearch/catalogue1/catalogue-10111/admission-financial-aid1/expenses.html">college tuition</a> (for reference I did get financial aid, but the point is that someone paid for it, so to me it should have been worth that amount).  I’d estimate that I read around 14 books a semester at most, maybe 110 books total.  That comes out to about $720 per book.  Granted, many of these were textbooks, but it still seems obvious that there’s a huge consumer surplus here. But say that I expect a specific book to be worth $300, assuming it’s worthwhile to read.  Even if there’s a 10% chance I’ll read it, it’s still worth $30 to me. Maybe this brings up the issue of having a huge bookshelf of stuff that you’ve mostly never read. Many people seem to think that’s a bit dishonest, but that’s obviously missing the point in this case.  It’s just practical. That said it is possible that books aren’t worth the time, and that college education is over valued by over an order of magnitude.  That’s a much harder question, and if true, would change a lot more than your decision to purchase books or not.</p>

			Why Not the 3-Hour Work Week?</a>

From The Four Hour Workweek:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“He took 6 prospective titles that everyone could live with: including ‘Broadband and White Sand’, ‘Millionaire Chameleon’ and ‘The 4-Hour Workweek’ and developed an Google Adwords campaign for each. He bid on keywords related to the book’s content including ‘401k’ and ‘language learning’: when those keywords formed part of someone’s search on Google the prospective title popped up as a headline and the advertisement text would be the subtitle. Ferriss was interested to see which of the sponsored links would be clicked on most, knowing that he needed his title to compete with over 200,000 books published in the US each year. At the end of the week, for less than $200 he knew that “The 4-Hour Workweek” had the best click-through rate by far and he went with that title.”
This was clever, but what I find most interesting is that his testing ended after one iteration.  Once he noticed that “The 4-Hour Workweek” did well, he could have tested each possible small variation.  Imagine “The 5-Hour Workweek” and “The Four Hour Workweek”.  In addition he may have realized that “The 4-Hour Workweek” sounded much more direct than the other two names, and tested other names inspired by that knowledge.  For example, “No Work on Weekdays” or “Finishing Work Before Finishing Coffee”. My suspicion is that he stopped because using Google Adwords sucks.  It’s not made for testing: it can be expensive and  <a href="http://www.pitstopmedia.com/sem/the-end-of-adwords-ab-testing-as-we-know-it">annoyingly difficult</a>.   Google Adwords was made for sending out ads in large batches, not for doing relatively minor work.  Also, Ferris’s experiment with book covers was cute, but doesn’t sound very scalable.  With proper testing it makes sense that he could have tried out hundreds of different and modified book covers to much greater success. Rahul (cofounder) and I have spent a lot of time looking into this issue of simple copy testing.  We even created our  <a href="http://www.wenameyou.com/">own website</a> t0 test text, and tried advertising it to little success (don’t try it now, the site is not currently functional).  One option we’ve grown fond of for general use is  <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome" title="Mechanical Turk">Mechanical Turk</a>.  It’s frustrating (though less so than Google Adwords) but they have recently made it a bit better with a  <a href="https://requester.mturk.com/tour/sentiment" title="Sentiment Analysis">sentiment analysis</a> package.   <a href="https://www.pickfu.com/">Pickfu</a> is another option but is significantly more expensive.  However, even Pickfu is cheaper and easier than Google Adwords. I believe that we’re just beginning to see the beginning of serious testing software for people who aren’t website designers or advertisers.  We just need people to start accepting them and for the technologies to be made more accessible to the public.</p>

			Case Study: Using Sentiment Analysis for Better Copy</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>For Raise, we decided to test out Mechanical Turk’s new Sentiment Analysis program to help us come up with a great tagline.  This sends out different text or image files to anonymous users online to rate according to a set standard.  While Mechanical Turk already provided the ability to create standard HITs (standard Mechanical Turk tasks), the Sentiment Analysis program makes the process of getting this one kind of feedback much more straightforward. From Mechanical Turk:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> ”Whether you want to track sentiment of tweets for a new product release or monitor sentiment of posts in a customers forum, Mechanical Turk makes it easy to assess sentiment quickly so you can make informed decisions.”
[caption id=”attachment_70” align=”alignnone” width=”560”] <a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-08-at-11-51-28-pm.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-08-at-11-51-28-pm.png?w=800" alt="Sentiment Analysis on Mechanical Turk" /> </a> Sentiment Analysis on Mechanical Turk[/caption] The interface is relatively simple.  You pick  an item (a slogan, for example), a question (“rate how much you like this slogan”), and then upload a .csv file with a list of all the possible slogans you want to test out.  You can choose anywhere between 10-20 ratings for each, which we’ve found to give a pretty consistant response. We tried out this technique with several slogan ideas we were considering.  But before I show you the response, try guessing the order that people preferred the following list:
- “Eyes Save Lives”
- “Charity Done Right”
- “Donate Without Paying”
- “We Give You Superpowers”
- “Help Things You Care About”
- “Join the Mission, Save the World”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our first test included 15 titles, each which had 10 votes.  At $0.02 per vote, that’s $3.00 (plus a bit extra for using Turk), which is ridiculously cheap for market research. When all the votes come in, you can see an analysis that looks like this: [caption id=”attachment_76” align=”alignnone” width=”560”] <a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-10-at-10-02-54-am.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-10-at-10-02-54-am.png?w=800" alt="Answer Summary" /> </a> Answer Summary[/caption] [caption id=”attachment_77” align=”alignnone” width=”560”] <a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-10-at-10-05-40-am.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-10-at-10-05-40-am.png?w=800" alt="Result Summary" /> </a> Result Summary[/caption]<br />
## Initial Results
Our first batch of slogans had the following average ratings: [caption id=”attachment_78” align=”aligncenter” width=”560”] <a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-10-at-10-08-23-am.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-10-at-10-08-23-am.png?w=800" alt="Average Ratings for Each Slogan Option" /> </a> Average Ratings for Each Slogan Option[/caption] Surprised?  In general these matched our intuitions (“Contribute Huge Free” does sound quite bad in retrospect), but we definitely updated our assumptions.  I threw away the idea of making the app superhero themed.  While several of the slogans were items I never intended on using (I personally don’t like the phrase “Save the World”), the idea was to try out a broad space of possibilities to see what people liked and work from there.  At a cost of $0.20 - $0.40 per slogan, it makes sense to test out a lot of strange things. Does this rating perfectly match what will work for our business?  Of course not!  This was a simple test to see which phrases people liked, which could be very different from which ones are good to associate with our product.  The audience is a bit different; Mechanical Turk has mostly a varied sample of computer savvy Americans and our audience is more specific (mostly female). What this does provide us is a simple heuristic to help guide our decision of what messages to pay attention to.  Because we have so many choices, we can discard all that do worse than average and still have plenty of options. In addition, if you want to get better at marketing, one measurable way of doing so is predicting the scores new items will get and measuring the results against those.  We haven’t been doing that yet, but are considering it going forward.  Hypothetically individuals with the most decision power should be those with the most prediction power, and in cases like this, that could be figured out quite well. <img src="http://bowlabs.wordpress.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" title="More..." />
##</p>

<h2 id="iteration">Iteration</h2>
<p>Once our initial experiment was complete, we evaluated the best ones and used our thoughts to help come up with new ideas.  We re-tested a few winners as well as several of the variations and new slogans we came up with.  The worst performing slogans were not re-tested.  We’re under the impression that there’s a margin of error (90% confidence) on these of about 0.4 (probably a bit less when doing 20 votes per entree).  We’ll have to do testing and rigorous analysis to get a better idea. [caption id=”attachment_84” align=”alignnone” width=”800”] <a href="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-10-at-2-15-17-pm.png"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-10-at-2-15-17-pm.png?w=800" alt="Iteration of our Product Tagline" /> </a> Iteration of our Product Tagline (Example)[/caption] We iterated this process 6 times so far.  The results are shown below.  For each experiment we ran a different set of slogans, so their ratings are only filled in where appropriate.

## Conclusions
We’re still in the process of doing testing on both our slogan and our website, and this process of iterative Sentiment Analysis seems to be going quite well so far.  We intend to test much of our other text, advertising copy, and our logo the same way. <strong>Some Take-Aways and Suggestions</strong>
- Mechanical Turk Sentiment Analysis can be combined with Iteration to produce consistently well rated copy.  
- Don’t do multiple trials at once.  This burned me out when I tried.  A better strategy seems to be to do one test a day for several days, which allows you to come up with some new ideas.  Plus, it’s not fun to wait for Mechanical Turk to finish (it’s estimated deadline can keep on increasing)
- In general, do 20 votes per item.  I often did 10 by accident, and think I got worse results because of it.  The cost is almost trivial anyway.
- Try a wide variety of strange things.  Most won’t work, but the ones that will may surprise you.
- Try predicting how well each item will do before you get feedback.  This will give you an idea of how well you are calibrated to this specific crowd.</p>

			Using Feedback Army for Efficiency and Insight</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I learned about <a href="http://www.feedbackarmy.com/" title="Feedbak Army">Feedback Army</a> when it launched a few years ago, and enjoyed it a whole lot then with <a href="http://holono.com/" title="Holono">Holono</a>.  It’s a service to send off questions you may have on your website and get customer feedback.  Feedback Army works by sending tasks to <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome" title="Mechanical Turk">Mechanical Turk</a>, so essentially is a pretty wrapper, but I’ve found it to be a useful one.  The cost is not that much more than that on Mechanical Turk, and because Mechanical Turk has such a bad UI, it can actually make some sense. <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-04-at-3-57-52-am.png?w=710" alt="Image" /> Previously in user testing of Raise people liked the website but were very confused by our message.  We’re in the middle of changing our landing page, so decided to use Feedback Army to get 25 responses on what people thought of our site as is.  We used the service to ask each person the following questions: 1. What does this site do? 2. What aspect of the site confused you? 3. What would improve this site? 4. How does it work? 5. If you were to come up with a slogan for the website, what would it be? The responses were much more positive than we were expecting, with most grasping the idea of the website.  Of course, much of this may well have been because the reviewers didn’t want to spend much time on it and “it’s good” is an shorter answer than “it’s confusing…”   There was still a bit of confusion, some bug finds, and some decent suggestions.  A few select quotes below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“The only thing that would need improving would be to make any text that is in a light gray color more darker for those of us who can’t see.”</li>
  <li>“It was not clear what the site does until I scrolled down a little and read the description.”</li>
  <li>“On the /features/ page, the line “Each month we will send out checks with that month’s revenue to each cause in the amounts mentioned on the side.”, it’s somewhat unclear what “…amounts mentioned on the side” means. My immediate reaction was to look at the sidebar of the page I was currently on. It should just say “…amounts shown.” or “…amounts stated on the summary page.” or something along those lines.”</li>
  <li>“On the /donations/ page. The numerical values representing contributions increase in real-time. Even though the numbers increase in varying amounts, their synchronous second-by-second updates implies a possibility that the figures to not actually represent actual numbers, but are just a product of predefined scripts. Updates triggered by actual page loads (or at random intervals, simulating triggering) will have a better impact on perception of accuracy.”</li>
  <li>“I think it’s best that this site not have a slogan. Slogans are starting to become cliche if they haven’t already. The title itself serves as a great self-slogan, but could be better if depicted with an arrow pointing straight up after the “e”, implying “direct and constant growth” (Rather than the current logo with an curved arrow up and over the “R”, which can imply “Plateauing”, or “Attempted effort”).”</li>
  <li>“ If I was supposed to pay for something or not I couldn’t really tell.”</li>
</ul>

<p>—————————————- Most of the responses this time were incredibly short, though a few were quite good.  Next time we’ll probably go straight to Mechanical Turk and put emphasis on writing a longer description. One good part was that people suggested slogans, and some may be good.  Here are some of the better ones:
- “Raise Awareness, Raise Hope”
- “Browse the web, Raise money for the world” (Surprisingly similar to our previously considered possibility, “Browse the web, change the world”
- “Raise your Awareness!”
- “Browse and Bestow”
- “Saving while Surfing”
- “Relief Replace Rejoice”
- “Helping Others is Only One Click Away”
- “Browse. Donate. Smile”</p>

<p>We’ll test a few of these on Mechanical Turk.  Results will be posted as they come in.
## Lessons Learned</p>

<ol>
  <li>Feedback Army is convenient, though the responses can be very short.</li>
  <li>Most users do seem to understand what Raise does from our current website.</li>
  <li>The specific way we donate (per time spent from initial user registration) is still unclear and unintuitive.</li>
  <li>Users are still concerned over the risk of downloading browser extensions, and if the money is actually going to their nonprofits.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can see all of our feedback from Feedback Army <a href="http://www.feedbackarmy.com/get_feedback.slp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.downloadraise.com&amp;code=e9fcb14f6e01ba18af71ac2848e87dc2" title="here">here</a>.</p>
