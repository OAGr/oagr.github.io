	<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/how-to-get-one/"> <img src="http://bowlabs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-25-at-3-17-00-pm1.png?w=922" alt="Google's #ifihadglass competition page" /> </a> Google’s <a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/how-to-get-one/"> #ifihadglass </a></p>

<p>After Google’s #ifihadglass competition came out, I thought it might be fun to make some entrees, given our research at Harvey Mudd in wearable computing.  While I was put off by the $1500 price tag, Rahul pointed out that they would likely have an ebay value quite a bit over that, so I decided to go with it.  We came up with the idea of organizing a small hackathon to come up with entrees, and after me asking a few people on Facebook, decided to make it happen.  However, this was on Wednesday, and the only day fit for the Hackathon was Saturday (it ended the week after), so we didn’t have much time to make it happen. </p>

<p>The domain <a href="http://www.ifwehadglass.com/">ifwehadglass.com</a> was available, so I decided to go with it.  Then I searched iStock Photo for an image somewhat similar to the google one, but with more people.  I found one, made a <a href="https://twitter.com/ifwehadglass">Twitter page</a>, made a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/572165209460571/">Facebook event</a>, and finally started a website.  Taking significant inspiration from the Google Glass website, I put together some custom CSS to make my own similar version, as shown below.  </p>

<p>The hardest part was the hosting it, which I did on Thursday evening after going to bed at 6.  After a bit of searching I found <a href="http://www.site44.com/">Site44</a>, which hosts websites straight out of Dropbox.  Awesome. Submitted it on Hacker News hoping to make front page.  <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5261470">Kind of did.</a></p>

<p>The last thing was to edit the website so that everyone could have their own page for their own entrees.  We made subdirectories for each entrant who signed up on Facebook.  Originally the plan was that each person would be able to access only their own folder.  However, we quickly realized that this would be a limitation.  First, it was impossible to share a folder from an app, so we had to switch from Site44 to one of <a href="https://twitter.com/Joevm3">Joe’s</a> many servers.  Then we realized that it’s impossible to share a folder with a few people, and share subfolders with other people.  So instead we just gave everyone access to everything.  In this case it’s fine, but you can imagine that it’s not a very scalable.  Come on, Dropbox! Some attempts were made at getting someone from Google to come with a Google Glass for the event, but they were made in vain.  Fortunately, the event was fun for the people who made it.            </p>
